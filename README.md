404 Page with Random Flash

I just wanted my website to display a random flash file for its 404 page so I made this but it became a lot more than I expected.

Flash files are checked for size so iframe can display them properly. This information is cached for performance.
Mobile devices use the same type of code but without cache or size checking. It also makes most mobile devices vibrate because why not.
A random error message is also shown to the user to keep a fresh sarcastic feel to it.
Download button for the currently viewed flash file. Hotlink available for those who want to send the page to a friend but show them the same flash file they saw. Font is smaller as to not distract.
